Our paper, [Schizosymphony: From Schizophrenia Brainwaves To Narrative Soundscapes](https://icad2024.icad.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ICAD_2024_paper_69.pdf), is accepted as an oral presentation at [ICAD 2024](https://icad2024.icad.org/)! This is my first time collaborating with a composer. We try to create an urban
soundscape using fMRI data of schizophrenia patients.
