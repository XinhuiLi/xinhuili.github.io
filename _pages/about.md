My name is Xinhui Li (黎欣惠). I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) and [Center for Translational Research in Neuroimaging and Data Science (TReNDS)](https://trendscenter.org/), advised by [Prof. Vince D. Calhoun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WNOoGKIAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Rogers F. Silva](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cMtwwG8AAAAJ&hl=en). During my PhD, I interned at [Amazon Science](https://www.amazon.science/) working on vision-language models. Previously, I developed a software pipeline [C-PAC](https://fcp-indi.github.io/) for MRI preprocessing and investigated [interpipeline agreement](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01942-4) at [Child Mind Institute](https://childmind.org/).

I used to be an engineer dreaming of connecting the brain and computer, and now I am growing as a scientist attempting to solve fundamental problems in neuroscience and computer science. My current research interests include representation learning, multimodal neuroimaging analysis, and AI for health and science. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the brain, I am developing a deep multidataset subspace analysis framework that includes linear and nonlinear latent variable models (ICA/IVA/ISA) to learn linked and identifiable representations from multimodal neuroimaging datasets. Lately, I have become interested in studying large language model capabilities and safety. More generally, I am fascinated by both biological and artificial intelligence. I believe that understanding the principles of neural computation will help us develop more flexible algorithms and build more energy-efficient machines. Please feel free to reach out if you want to discuss research questions or collaboration opportunities.

I love art in many forms. I often spend my free time at museums and theaters. I also collaborate with talented artists to create artwork related to my research, such as [Butterfly Effect](https://sciartwonderatl.wixsite.com/sawatl/copy-of-kaufman-hatzell) and [Schizosymphony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yph2hXzY9Dc). I am happily married to [Yannan Chen](https://yannan-chen.github.io/).
